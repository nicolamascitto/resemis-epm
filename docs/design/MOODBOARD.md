# ReSemis EPM UI Moodboard

This moodboard synthesizes modern dashboard patterns for an enterprise EPM product used by executives, managers, and HR/finance stakeholders.

## Visual Direction

- Professional minimalism: high-contrast typography, generous whitespace, constrained color palette with one accent.
- Data-first hierarchy: top KPI strip, focused chart modules, then diagnostics tables.
- Calm depth: soft radii, subtle panel shadows, restrained motion, clear affordances for filters and drill-down.

## Pattern Extraction

- KPI strip at top with trend + delta and one headline value per card.
- Left navigation + top control bar as the persistent shell.
- Filter chips/dropdowns grouped by time, business unit, manager/team scope.
- Right contextual panel for selected entity details and actions.
- Grid modules that each answer one question (trend, distribution, variance, risk).
- Dense tables only after high-level charts; include pagination and status badges.
- Light and dark themes using shared semantic tokens (not one-off component overrides).
