# Concerns
- Annual workbook formulas vs monthly engine timing create expected reconciliation drift on cash/EV.
- Full 0.1% match requires a dedicated annual-mode engine or tighter monthly interpolation assumptions.
- Streamlit Community Cloud free tier has resource limits that may affect concurrency under larger team use.
- GitLab remote is not configured in this repository yet; deployment mirrors require remote setup.
