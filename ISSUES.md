# Issues

- Need tighter monthly timing calibration to fully eliminate ending-cash variance versus annual workbook links.
- EV variance remains because workbook valuation horizon/terminal mechanics are annual-linked while engine runs monthly discounting.
- Conservative/aggressive workbook-native assumptions are not provided in the source workbook; current overrides remain generic.
